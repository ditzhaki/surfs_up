# Surfs Up

## Overview

We are interested in opening a surf n' shake shop in Hawaii that serves surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists. W.avy is an investor with previous experience with surf shops and is concerned about the weather year-round. To ensure that the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round, he has asked for a weather analysis, specifically temperature data for the months of June and Decemeber in Oahu. Using Python, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask, the following results were obtained. 

## Results

All in all, the data obtained concludes that Oahu is an ideal location for a year-round surf and ice cream shop.

* The average temperatures in June and December vary only by about 3 degrees. This tells us that there is not much variablity in temperature in the summer versus in the winter.
* The minimum temperature in December reaches 56 degrees which is a relatively reasonable temperature for ice cream and surfing, however, our histogram also reflects that the frequency of days with low temperature are low. The majority of days appear to have temperatures resembling closer to the average temps. 
* The average rainfall in Oahu is roughly .177 inches, therefore, precipation should not be a major issue.

## Summary

In conclusion, from the data gathered we can see that Oahu is the optimal location for a surf and ice cream shop. The weather appears to be relatively warm year-round, with little variability in temperature and low precipation stats. In order to expand the analysis in the future, a few additional queries can be performed. Specifically, we can gather data for the average amount of sunny days year-round as opposed to cloudy days and obtain the stats regarding the wind speed on the island. Both of these conditions can impact a good surfing day.
